In the doc/reference directory is a Makefile and supporting files to
generate basic API documentation for the "toolkit" portion of
AMIDE. 

Currently, this toolkit is not distributed as an independent library,
so this documentation is of limited utility and is only regenerated
intermittently.

The API documentation generation is based on that used for gtk. It can be
enabled with the --enable-gtk-doc configuration switch. As of
2012.01.10, it does not build correctly if libdcmdata support is also
configured in.
